00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,139
Ever wondered what's truly making your phone screen so vibrant or maybe that massive 8k TV so incredibly sharp and responsive it's not just the pixels themselves but a tiny unsung hero behind each one the thin film Transistor or TFT.
Today we're diving deep into a comprehensive report on TFT technology.
Our mission uncover its surprising history, understand the ingenious way it works, reveal what it truly enables in modern electronics and maybe peek into its fascinating future.

2
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:37,000
Get ready for some serious AHA moments.
Okay let's unpack this. So when you look at TFTS, their story starts surprisingly early, doesn't it

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:53,225
does the core concept A thin film moss FET was actually patented way back in 1957 John Walmart at RCA and just five years later 1962, Paul Mimer, also at RCA, created the very first actual TFT using materials like cadmium selenide early

4
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:56,583
Okay but the real game changer, the thing that made mass production possible

5
00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:23,950
exactly that moment arrived in 1979.
Researchers at Dundee University developed the hydrogenated amorphous silicon or a CCI TFT.
This wasn't just another step, it was a leap.
It paved the way for mass production fundamentally changing displays.
Then we saw low temperature polycrystalline silicon LTPS emerge from Hitachi in 86 offering much, much higher performance O.

6
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:33,267
And more recently, 2012 marked the mass production of displays using indium gallium zinc oxide Igzo.
That's really reshaped the landscape again.

7
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:39,417
So why are these tiny switches just so crucial?
Not just historically but right now in our everyday electronics?

8
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:46,687
Well, fundamentally, TFTS were the technology that allowed us to move from those, you know, basic, often blurry passive matrix screen

9
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:47,805
I to remember those

10
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:55,074
to the high performance active matrix displays we absolutely rely on today.
They give us that precise individual pixel control.
That's the foundation.

11
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,752
It's not just screens anymore is

12
00:01:56,752 --> 00:02:18,559
no, not at all and that's what's truly fascinating.
TFTS are extending into really diverse areas.
Think digital X ray detectors in hospitals, transparent head up displays in cars and aircraft cockpits, various types of sensors like biosensors, pressure sensors and flexible electronics.
Of course, this continuous evolution of materials from those early cadmium compounds,

13
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:29,240
SSI, then LTPS, then the metal oxides like IGZO and now even newer things like organic materials, carbon nanotubes.
It's all directly linked to our demands

14
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,917
for performance, right?
And new shape

15
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:44,339
exactly performance and crucially new form factors, flexible transparent devices.
It really shows how material science just drives electronic innovation forward, enabling things we couldn't even dream of with conventional.

16
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:51,399
Okay so to really grasp the magic, let's look inside.
How does a TFT actually work layer by layer and what makes it different?

17
00:02:51,399 --> 00:03:15,130
Right? So at its heart a TFT is a marvel of microscopic layering.
Imagine building a tiny tiny sandwich.
You start with a non conductive substrate.
That's the base. Often it's transparent glass for displays or maybe flexible plastic for newer Tech.
On top of that, you deposit the crucial semiconductor layer.
This is the active material like amorphous silicon or maybe IGZO that controls the current flow

18
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,250
the work horse layer

19
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:25,103
sort of yeah then there's an insulating dielectric layer.
This separates the semiconductor from the gate electrode, which is a tiny metal contact.

20
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:26,480
The gate is the control.

21
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:42,240
Precisely, it acts as the control knob.
Then flanking the semiconductor, you have the source and drain electrodes.
These are the input and output terminals for the current.
It's this really intricate architecture all built up in these super thin films that gives us that precise pixel control.

22
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,490
So how does that control knob the gate actually switch things on and off?

23
00:03:46,490 --> 00:04:03,806
Ah, the magic it lies in what's called field effect modulation.
When you apply a tiny voltage to that gate electrode, it creates an electric field within the semiconductor channel.
And this field precisely controls the flow of charge carriers, electrons or holes between the source and drain.

24
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:06,609
So it's like opening or closing a gate for electricity.

25
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:29,049
Exactly if the gate voltage is below a certain point, the threshold voltage, almost no current flows the pixel is effectively off.
But if you exceed that threshold voltage, a layer of charge carriers forms and boom current flows the pixel is on and the amount of current is directly controlled by that gate volt.
So it's like a super precise dimmer switch for every single pixel

26
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:35,198
and in a display, that means each TFT works with a pixel element and importantly, a capacitor too.

27
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:43,580
Yes exactly the TFT acts as the pixel's on off switch.
But the capacitor is crucial too.
It helps the pixel hold its charge between refreshes

28
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,385
so that improves responsiveness, stops flickering.

29
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:55,920
Precisely, it keeps the pixel stable.
And for LCDs, the TFT voltage changes how the liquid crystals align, controlling how much light from the back light gets through to make the image

30
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:03,017
got it. Now you mentioned transistors before how does a TFT differ from say the traditional monfets we find in computer chips

31
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:27,345
that's a really key distinction.
While TFTS are a type of field effect transistor, they're fundamentally different from traditional bulk moss fats.
In a bulk moss vet, the semiconductor material is the substrate usually a silicon wafer with TFTS, all the active components, the semiconductor, the insulator the electrodes are deposited as thin films onto an inert substrate like lass or plastic

32
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:29,035
built on the base, not out of the base.

33
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:55,000
Exactly this thin film approach is a genuine paradigm shift.
It allows for a much wider variety of substrates, including those flexible plastics.
It enables large area devices, flexible devices, transparent devices things largely impossible with conventional silicon wafers and crucially for displays, it needs smaller charges to switch, which means faster screen refresh rates.
For active matrix displays, it really unlocks completely new device physics and form factor.

34
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,624
That makes perfect sense.
So we know how it's built, how it switches but what separates a really good TFT from a basic one?
It often comes down to a few key electrical numbers, right?

35
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:18,497
Absolutely performance is defined by a few critical parameters.
First, there's threshold voltage or 5th This is simply the minimum gate voltage needed to turn the transistor on to get significant current flowing.

36
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:19,616
Stability here is key,

37
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:25,213
absolutely critical especially for OLED displays.
If VTH fluctuates even slightly across the panel,

38
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:26,332
you get uneven brightness

39
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:37,450
exactly you get what's called MIRA visible blotches or streaks.
It looks terrible. That's why complex compensation circuits are often built in, especially in high end displays to counteract those variations.

40
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:45,450
Okay 5th stability then we have field effect mobility.
IFE the report highlights this one sounds like speed

41
00:06:45,450 --> 00:07:00,910
you got it. Think of field effect mobility as the speed limit for charge carriers in the semiconductor channel.
How quickly can they move when the electric field is applied?
Higher is better much better.
Higher mobility means faster switching, faster device operation and better current driving ability.

42
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:13,750
It's essential for high Res, high refresh rate displays and logic circuits too.
So old amorphous silicon or ASCI TFTS their mobility is quite low around one centimeters over speeds like being stuck in traffic slow

43
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:22,582
but then LTPS came along.
Low temperature polycrystalline silicon its mobility around a 100 centimeter CVS

44
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,940
Wow, a 100 times faster

45
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:42,320
massive leap like hitting an open highway.
That's what suddenly made super fast refresh rates and really crisp high RES screens possible.
Oxide semiconductors like Igzeo land somewhere in between often above 10 centimeters CVS still a big improvement over Assi.
Some newer ones are pushing even higher

46
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:49,584
okay speed matters. And finally there's the on off current ratio IAF what's the deal with that?

47
00:07:49,584 --> 00:08:10,540
This ratio compares the current when the transistor is fully on to the tiny bit of current that might still leak through when it's supposed to be off.
A high ratio a huge difference between on and off is crucial that two main reasons efficient switching and low power consumption.
You want the pixel to turn truly off.
This allows for deep true blacks and displays leading to high contrast ratios.

48
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:19,839
If current leaks through when it's off, your blacks look grayish got it and low off current means less wasted power.
Oxide TFTS are particularly good here.
Their off current is incredibly low

49
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:44,030
so they sip power when IDOL exactly this enables things like flicker free, low refresh rates for still images like reading text on a tablet, saving significant battery life.
We're talking ratios that can be enormous over 10 to the power of 8, even 10 to the 10 in some cases almost zero leakage.
So yeah these parameters, 5th stability, mobility and the on off ratio are all interconnected.

50
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:53,450
Engineers are constantly playing this balancing act to optimize them for the specific application, ensuring quality and reliability.
It's a non stop optimization challenge

51
00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:05,199
makes perfect sense. So this brings us right to the materials themselves.
The choice of semiconductor is obviously paramount and it really feels like a story of continuous evolution solving one problem only to tackle the next.

52
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:23,559
Absolutely it's a fantastic example of materials science driving technology.
We started, as I mentioned with amorphous silicon ASCI TFTS.
For a long time they were the workhorse.
Their manufacturing is relatively simple, cost effective, scalable and crucially, it can be done at lower temperatures, which works well with large glass substrates.

53
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,224
The performance wasn't stellin,

54
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:36,596
right? That low mobility around one centimeter of ease meant slower response times, limitations on resolution and refresh rates.
They also tend to use more power than newer options.

55
00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:37,718
It's still used today.

56
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:46,131
Yeah you find them in plenty of standard computer monitors, entry level smartphones where cost effectiveness is the main driver.
They do the job

57
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:53,423
okay and then when higher performance became essential, especially for mobile devices, we saw the rise of LTPS TFTS.

58
00:09:53,423 --> 00:10:20,309
Exactly low temperature polycrystalline silicon LTPS brought that massive jump in mobility.
Remember around 100 centimeter of this a 100 fold leap right?
This enabled truly high resolution, lower power consumption because the transistors could be smaller and much faster switching suddenly you had superior display quality, brightness, color accuracy perfect for advanced smartphones high in laptops, tablets, wearables there's a catch there's always a catch.

59
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:31,409
The trade off is a much more complex and expensive manufacturing process.
It requires higher temperatures, even if low compared to traditional silicon processing and advanced equipment like lasers for crystallization.

60
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:33,638
So harder to scale up for really big screens.

61
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:44,870
Yes typically more difficult and costly to scale for very large panels compared to Asi.
So LTPS tends to be for premium performance in smaller, high value devices.

62
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:57,628
Okay so we have a low cost, scalable option ASSI and a high performance but expensive and size limited option LTPS.
This sounds like a classic engineering dilemma.
What emerged to bridge that gap?

63
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:19,275
That's exactly where oxide semiconductor TFTS come in materials like Igzo, indium, gallium, zinc oxide or just zinc oxide, Zno.
They've really emerged as a kind of optimal compromise how so well they offer good mobility typically ranging from one to 100 centimeter Ofiz, often landing comfortably above 10 centimeter ofes for Idzio, which is significantly better performance than ASI

64
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:33,700
maybe not quite as high as LTPS generally but a big step up plus they have high stability and they can be transparent critically.
Their processing temperatures are lower than LTPS, making them compatible with existing ICI manufacturing lines and even flexible plastic substrates.

65
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,813
Cost effective for big screen,

66
00:11:34,813 --> 00:11:40,976
more cost effective and scalable for large panels than Ltpses.
And remember that incredibly low off current we talked about

67
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:42,657
right the power saving aspect

68
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:58,960
it's a huge advantage makes them super power efficient especially for those low refresh rates on still images.
So these are driving today's high end 8k LCD TVS at 120 hertz or more.
You also find them in tablets, laptops, medical displays, even epaper.
They're very versal,

69
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:09,865
very interesting and then on the horizon or perhaps just starting to emerge, we have organic thin film transistors, Otfts.
What's their unique play?

70
00:12:09,865 --> 00:12:25,900
Otfts are really about flexibility and potentially very low cost.
They use organic carbon based semiconductors.
The big potential advantage is low manufacturing cost often using solution based methods like printing almost like an inkjet printer for electronics and they can be inherently flexible.

71
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,573
Performance has been a challenge

72
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:37,661
historically. Yes their mobility has generally been lower than inorganic TFTS like oxides or LTPS.
But there are constant advancements with some reaching respectable levels.
Now

73
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:38,782
where are we seeing them?

74
00:12:38,782 --> 00:13:00,295
Primarily emerging in highly flexible displays, rollable screens and certain types of wearable devices where that extreme bendability and potential low cost are the primary drivers.
So yeah, this whole evolution SI to LTPS, then to oxide TFTS and now exploring Otfts it really represents a strategic response from the industry to that constant performance, cost Scalability triangle.

75
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:01,420
I'm trying to find the sweet

76
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:23,080
exactly. ASSI is cheap and scalable, but low performance LTCS is high performance but costly and size limited.
Oxide TFTS hit a sweet spot for many applications better performance than AI, more scalable and cost effective than LTPS for large sizes.
It shows that progress isn't always about the absolute peak performance, but finding the optimal balance to meet different market needs.

77
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:32,629
Given all these different materials and the need for such thin, precise layers, I imagine building a TFT is incredibly complex.
Can you walk us through the basic manufacturing journey?

78
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:56,787
It's absolutely a marvel of precision engineering.
Like any semiconductor manufacturing, it involves multiple, highly controlled steps, often repeated multiple times.
It all starts crucially with an extremely rigorous cleaning process for the substrate usually glass.
Any speck of dust, any oil, any tiny impurity can ruin the final device.
Cleanliness is paramount

79
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:58,977
makes sense. Then the layers start getting

80
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:10,240
yes. Then comes thin film deposition.
This is where those incredibly thin layers, the semiconductor, the dielectric insulator, the metal contacts for the electrodes are carefully built up one by one.

81
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,363
And how are these thin films actually deposited?
What are the techni?

82
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:40,594
There are several key methods for metal films like the gate or source drain electrodes.
Sputtering is common. You basically bombard a target material with ions, knocking atoms off that then deposit onto the substrate.
For non metal films like the amorphous silicon semiconductor or the silicon nitride insulator, chemical vapor deposition, CBD is widely used.
Often it's plasma enhanced CBD or pace CBD, which uses plasma to help the chemical reactions happen at lower temperatures.

83
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:42,056
Lower temperatures seem important,

84
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:54,079
very important, especially for large glass or flexible substrates and that leads to an exciting emerging method, particularly for those metal oxide TFTS atomic layer deposition or ALD.

85
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,530
What's special about ALD?

86
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:17,182
ALD builds the film literally one atomic layer at a time through sequential self limiting chemical reactions.
It offers incredibly uniform films, precise thickness control down to the single atom layer and high film quality often at even lower temperatures than Piecevd.
It's a huge advantage for high performance oxides and delicate substrates.

87
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:22,786
Wow layer by layer okay so you've deposited a layer How do you create the actual circuit pattern?

88
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:40,900
That's where photolithography comes in.
It's the critical patterning step.
Think of it like microscopic photographic printing.
You coat the deposited film with a light sensitive material called photoresist.
Then you place a mask which has the desired circuit pattern over it and expose it to light, usually UV light.
Depending on the type of resist,

89
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:50,635
either the exposed or the unexposed parts become soluble.
In a developer solution you wash away the soluble parts, leaving the resist patterned exactly like the mask

90
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:53,035
of a pattern protective layer.
Then what

91
00:15:53,035 --> 00:16:11,113
then comes the etching process?
The pattern resist protects the areas of the thin film you want to keep.
The unprotected areas are then removed, etched away.
This can be done using wet etching with chemical solutions or dry etching which uses reactive gases and plasma technology for more precise directional

92
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:12,757
got it transferring the pattern

93
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:34,260
exactly. Finally, the stripping process removes any remaining photoresist, leaving behind the perfectly patterned thin film layer.
And this whole sequence deposition, photolithography etching stripping is repeated multiple times historically maybe four to 8 mask steps sometimes fewer now due to process improvements to build up the complete multi layer TFT structure.

94
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:41,530
That sounds incredibly intricate and demanding.
What are the biggest manufacturing challenges the industry faces and how are they driving innovation?

95
00:16:41,530 --> 00:17:00,361
You hit it? Precision at massive scale is inherently challenging.
A major hurdle is process temperature sensitivity.
We talked about how many newer substrates, especially flexible plastics, just can't handle high heat.
So developing reliable, high performance, low temperature manufacturing processes is absolutely essential

96
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:02,590
which is where oxides and ALD come in handy.

97
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:17,160
Exactly they are key enablers.
Another challenge is patterning resolution as pixels get smaller and densities higher for 4k, 8k and beyond.
Achieving those incredibly fine defect free patterns pushes the limits of photolithography and etching

98
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,831
and cost and scale always

99
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:33,565
always Scalability and cost.
While traditional batch processing on glass sheets is well established, there's a constant drive for even more scalable, higher throughput and lower cost methods, especially as we look towards truly ubiquitous flexible electronics.

100
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:36,913
What new manufacturing approaches are emerging to tackle these

101
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:58,050
several exciting developments?
We mentioned printing technologies.
The dream is to essentially print the entire TFT structure simultaneously depositing and patterning.
This offers huge potential for Scalability, lower cost and less material waste.
Historically, resolution and required high temperature and healing were challenges, but progress is being made.

102
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:19,554
We also talked about atomic layer deposition, ALD providing that exceptional control and quality at low temperatures, which is really promising for nextgen oxide TFTS and for truly mass produced flexible devices.
Roll to roll R2R manufacturing is a major focus.
Instead of processing rigid sheets, you process a continuous flexible roll like printing a newspaper

103
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:21,239
huge potential for cost reductions

104
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:39,823
massive it's highly scalable.
Combining high resolution RTR photolithography with ALD deposition is seen as a very promising pathway for the mass production of flexible high resolution TFTS in the future.
This constant evolution in manufacturing Tech really shows the industry's relentless push to meet new performance and cost targets.

105
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:52,132
Okay so we know TFTS are the absolute backbone of our displays from the phone in your pocket to that giant TV on the wall.
Let's quickly recap how they power our visual world and then really dig into those other surprising applications

106
00:18:52,132 --> 00:19:08,369
sounds good. So for displays, it's all about that individual pixel control.
In TFT LCDs, each pixel has its own TFT switch.
It controls the voltage applied to the liquid crystals, which then act like tiny shutters modulating light coming from a separate backlight to form the image

107
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:10,038
as high resolution good color

108
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:32,908
clarity, fast response compared to older Tech vivid colors.
Then you have Amyleds active matrix organic light emitting diodes here the TFT backplane controls pixels that are self emissive OLEDs no backlight needed correct which means true perfect blacks because the pixel can be completely off infinite contrast, wider viewing angles, super fast response times they look fantast

109
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:34,690
the newer micro LEDs.

110
00:19:34,690 --> 00:20:03,709
Yes, micro LED displays are an emerging Tech known for amazing color, very high brightness, low power and fast response.
Oxide based TFTS are often used to drive these tiny inorganic LEDs providing the necessary control.
So across all these LCD OLED microled, the TFT back plane is what enables that individual pixel control, leading to incredibly high resolutions up to 8k fast refresh rates, great color brightness and contrast.
It's the EN

111
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:11,540
that's impressive enough for displays but what still got blows my mind is how this fundamental switching ability is now being applied in completely different fields.

112
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:33,810
Here's where it gets really interesting.
Beyond just making pretty pictures the core idea of an individually addressable switch on a large area is incredibly powerful.
Take digital radiation detectors like for medical X rays, large TFT arrays form the active matrix backplane for the image sensors, allowing for high quality, high resolution digital X ray images replacing traditional film.
We're think about head up display

113
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:39,829
huds and aircraft and increasingly in cars, optically transparent TFT devices are being developed

114
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:42,049
can see info projected without looking away

115
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:50,440
exactly information overlaid directly onto your view of the road or sky requires transparent transistors, transparent electrodes the whole package.

116
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,678
That's a huge leap from just a screen.
What about s

117
00:20:52,678 --> 00:21:09,099
a big area there too sensing and detection.
You can build TFT based biosensors to detect specific biomarkers or biomolecules with high sensitivity for medical diagnostics.
Pressure sensors using TFT arrays are common in touch screens obviously, but also in wearable devices for monitoring.

118
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:22,260
We're even seeing proposals for hybrid systems combining large area TFT arrays with conventional silicon CMOS chips on the same platform for complex sensor systems detecting light fingerprints, temperature PH levels, gases,

119
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,043
you name it. So leveraging the large area of TFTS with the processing power of silicon

120
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:53,869
precisely and it doesn't stop there.
TFTS are being researched for logic circuits and computing applications because they can be low power and operate at high speeds especially oxides and LTPS.
Their ability to be made on flexible substrates is the key enabler for all kinds of flexible electronics, bendable displays, conformable sensors, smart fabrics and maybe the most futuristic TFTS can even be used to implement architectures inspired by the human brain for neuromorphic computing

121
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:56,992
mimicking neural networks directly in hardware

122
00:21:56,992 --> 00:22:08,389
incredible versatility from X rays to brain like computing the idea of them potentially complementing or even replacing traditional silicon gips in certain areas that sounds revolutionary.

123
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:29,650
It really points towards that direction in specific applications.
The active matrix concept, which was perfected for displays, is now being generalized anywhere you need individual control, sensing or processing over a large area, especially if flexibility or transparency is needed.
TFTS offer unique advantages shows how a core technological principle can unlock an absolute explosion of new possibilities.

124
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:45,300
Okay so we've covered a lot of history how they work, manufacturing incredible applications.
Let's try to bring it together.
What are the biggest, clearest advantages that have made TFT technologies so pervasive?
And on the flip side, what are the trade offs?
Engineers are still wrestling?

125
00:22:45,300 --> 00:23:01,250
All right let's sum up the strengths first the most obvious one we experience every day is high resolution and clarity.
That individual pixel control lets TFT displays deliver incredibly crisp detailed images full HD 4k, 8k.
It just keeps getting better,

126
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,369
a more blocky pixel.

127
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:25,650
This also translates directly to fast response time.
Individual transistors switch pixels rapidly, which is absolutely crucial for smooth motion in video and gaming.
It dramatically reduces motion, blur, and ghosting compared to older passive matrix Tech.
Then there's superior color accuracy and brightness.
Modern TFT Tech supports wide color gamuts for vibrant life like colors

128
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:35,150
they can achieve really high brightness levels, especially LCDs with powerful LED backlights ensuring visibility even in bright sunlight and delivering excellent contrast ratio.

129
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,938
And they've enabled thinner, lighter devices

130
00:23:37,938 --> 00:24:02,625
absolutely design flexibility and slimness.
Their thin film nature allows for very light weight and thin panels perfect for smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables and the ability to use flexible plastic substrates is pushing design boundaries even further with foldable and rollable devices.
Power consumption generally, energy efficiency is a big plus compared to older technologies like CRTS or even plasma displays.

131
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:11,920
Modern TFT LCDs, particularly with LED backlights, are relatively energy efficient, which is vital for extending battery life in portable gadgets.

132
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:18,443
Okay, those are some compelling advantages but no technology is without its challenges.
What are some of the downsides or considerations?

133
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:41,484
True? There are always trade offs.
One persistent factor is cost.
While prices have plummeted over the years thanks to massive scale high performance TFT models, especially those using LTPS or cutting edge oxides, can still be expensive due to the specialized equipment, complex processes and advanced materials need for traditional TFT LCDs.
A key consideration is the backlight requirements.

134
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:50,938
Unlike OLEDs or microlides, they don't emit their own light they need that separate backlight unit.
This adds some thickness, complexity and contributes to power consumption

135
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:53,171
and viewing angles used to be an issue.

136
00:24:53,171 --> 00:25:09,350
Historically limited viewing angle was a drawback for some TFT LCD types, mainly older TN panels.
You'd see color shifts or brightness drops when viewing off center technologies like IPS have vastly improved this.
But it's something that OLEDs naturally excel at

137
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,030
and the manufacturing process itself

138
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:36,108
the manufacturing complexity is significant.
All those intricate steps, deposition, photolithography, etching, stripping repeated multiple times require massive investment in specialized equipment and ultra clean room environments.
This complexity can impact yields meaning how many good panels you get from a production run especially for newer, more advanced technologies like LTPS or high RES oxides Lower yields mean higher costs

139
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:40,013
and even power consumption while better than old Tech isn't perfect

140
00:25:40,013 --> 00:26:03,250
correct while generally efficient power consumption for high resolution screens can still be notable.
Driving more pixels, especially at higher brightness levels needed for HDR content on 4k and 8K screens inevitably requires more power.
There's a constant push pull between resolution, brightness and power draw.
So what this really highlights is that the advantages and disadvantages are often relative.

141
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:23,465
They depend heavily on the specific TFT material being used AI versus LTPS versus oxide and the application you're comparing it to.
It's always a trade off always for instance, we praise TFT LCDs for being energy efficient compared to old CRTS.
But OLEDs are often more energy efficient, especially displaying dark content because they can turn pixels completely off.

142
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:44,313
Similarly, a limitation of one type like the low mobility of ASSI becomes the driving force to develop the next generation like LTPS or oxides.
But those then introduce new trade offs like higher cost or different manufacturing challenges.
It's this constant dynamic cycle of innovation, optimization and balancing competing constraints within the display industry and beyond.

143
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:54,675
Given this relentless innovation and the balancing act involved, what does the future hold for TFTS?
What are the big trends that are really going to shape what we see next?

144
00:26:54,675 --> 00:27:15,845
The future looks incredibly dynamic.
One major driving force is absolutely the advancement of flexible and transparent TFTS.
The demand for truly flexible electronics, wearable devices that conform to the body rollable TVS, bendable displays integrated into unconventional surfaces is huge.
Metal oxide semiconductors are really key enablers

145
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:18,088
because they could be made at low temperatures on plastic

146
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:39,699
exactly enabling flexible, lightweight, transparent, even stretchable and potentially biodegradable analog circuits.
We're seeing research into transparent TFT devices for those head up displays we mentioned using transparent substrates and electrodes.
There are even innovations in the device structure itself like vertical TFTS being explored to reduce mechanical stress when flexing.

147
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:47,296
So screens that can literally wrap around your wrist or maybe even disappear into a surface when not in use that's getting into SIPHI territory

148
00:27:47,296 --> 00:28:12,575
feels like it but the research is pushing hard in that direction.
Another key focus area is definitely high performance oxide TFTS and enhanced stability.
Oxides like Igzo, ZNO and related materials continue to be a primary research target.
Why? Because they offer that great combination of high charge carrier mobility, super low off current good process compatibility with existing lines, optical transparency and flexibility

149
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:14,259
so pushing their performance even higher

150
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:39,520
Yes, improving mobility further but also critically enhancing their stability, making sure they perform reliably under various stresses, constant electrical bias, humidity, temperature changes.
New materials are being explored like amorphous zinc tin oxide Azto, which has shown better resilience to X ray radiation than Igzo, making it promising for those medical detectors.
New device structures like dual gates are also being used to improve stability.

151
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,229
Alongside improving oxides, are we seeing entirely new emerging materials and manufacturing methods coming into play

152
00:28:46,229 --> 00:29:08,169
absolutely beyond the established silicon and metal oxides researchers are heavily investigating other candidates organic semiconductors for printing and ultimate flexibility carbon nanotubes for potentially very high performance.
Even exotic materials like metal halide porofskites are being explored for their unique electronic and optical properties.
Although stability is often a challenge, there

153
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:09,290
new ways to make them.

154
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:34,530
Yes on the manufacturing front, advanced deposition techniques like atomic layer deposition ALD are gaining serious traction for making high performance, low temperature metal oxide TFTS with that incredible precision and uniformity we discussed and for really scaling up flexible devices.
Combining ALD with high resolution roll to roll R to our photolithography is seen as a very promising path towards mass production.

155
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:42,925
This all sounds less like incremental improvement and more like a fundamental reimagining of how these tiny switches are made and what they can ultimately do

156
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:50,213
feels that way. And perhaps one of the most important trends tying some of this together is LTPO technology and hybrid circuit integration.

157
00:29:50,213 --> 00:29:54,697
TPO I've heard that term associated with new phone screens.
What is it exactly?

158
00:29:54,697 --> 00:30:07,591
LTPO stands for Low temperature Polycrystalline oxide.
It's a clever hybrid approach that combines both Pettype LTPS TFTS good for hole transport and end type oxide TFTS good for electron transport on the same substrate.

159
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:08,712
Why comby them?

160
00:30:08,712 --> 00:30:27,384
Combining them you can create hybrid complimentary metal oxide semiconductor or CMOS circuits directly on the display backplane.
Traditional Cmos uses P type and end type silicon Mosfets.
Doing this with LTPS and oxides allows for more complex circuits that are much more power efficient than using just one type of TFT alone.

161
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:30,995
So that's how they achieve those variable refresh rates that save power.

162
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:49,660
Exactly. LTPO is particularly promising for advanced displays.
It enables things like dynamically adjusting the refresh rate down to very low levels like one hertz for Alwegon displays to save significant power in smartphones and watches.
It can also be used for sophisticated compensation circuits and OLEDs to improve uniformity and lifespan

163
00:30:49,660 --> 00:31:10,010
beyond displays. This idea of hybrid circuit integration extends to combining large area TFT arrays with conventional silicon CMOS chips for enhanced sensing and computing capabilities, leveraging the best of both worlds.
So putting it all together, it suggests TFTS are undergoing a truly transformative phase.
They're evolving far beyond just being simple pixel switches.

164
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:23,849
They're enabling more complex circuit functions, integrating sensing, becoming flexible and transparent and potentially complementing or even replacing traditional silipan and whole new classes of electronics the next generation of ubiquitous, flexible and high performance systems.

165
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:51,619
Wow, what a journey indeed from a patent nearly 70 years ago, thin film transistors have gone from yeah, a simple on off switch concept to the sophisticated invisible backbone of our most vivid screens.
And now clearly so much more.
We've really seen this incredible dance between pushing performance, managing those costs, achieving massive scale all driven by just relentless innovation in materials science and manufacturing techniques.

166
00:31:51,619 --> 00:32:10,660
It's that fundamental ability of the TFT to act as an individually addressable switch combined with these continuous advancements in materials and how we make them that's allowing them to expand their reach far beyond just displays.
They are truly a critical enabling technology shaping the future of flexible, transparent and high performance electronics.

167
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:30,780
As TFT technology keeps evolving, bigging our screens even more brilliant enabling devices that can bend and fold.
It makes you wonder what other everyday objects might transform into interactive surfaces in the near future Could your entire desk become a display or maybe the window?
It's certainly something to ponder.
Thank you for joining us on this deep dive into the world of thin film transistors.
Keep exploring.
