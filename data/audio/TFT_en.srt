00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,832
Welcome to the deep dive.
Today we're digging into your sources on thin film transistors, TFTS.
They're kind of the unsung heroes behind almost every screen you at

2
00:00:09,832 --> 00:00:12,310
absolutely hidden in plain sight really.

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:28,180
So our mission today is well to peel back the layers on how these things evolved and where else they pop up beyond just the displays we all know okay let's get started. For anyone maybe not familiar, what exactly is a thin film transistor like at its core.

4
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:46,439
right So a TFT is basically a microscopic on off switch.
Think of it controlling a single pixel on your screen.
Technically it's a type of field effect transistor, an FET but the key part is that all its active bits, the semiconductor, the insulator, the electrodes they're all deposited as really thin film

5
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,555
thin layers okay

6
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:53,435
onto a base, a substrate that doesn't conduct electricity, usually glass or sometimes plastic.

7
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:58,843
And looking at the history in these sources, this isn't exactly brand new Tech is it?
It goes back surprisingly far

8
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:24,699
that's right yeah the basic idea was actually patented way back in 1957 by John Walmark 57.
Yeah and then Paul Weimer built the first working one in 1962 but the real game changer for like mass production came in 79 okay what happened then that was when they figured out hydrogenated amorphous silicon TFTs that made them practical for the early LCDs everyone started seeing then later you got LTPS

9
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:39,940
low temperature polycrystalline silicon around 86, pushing for better performance, sharper screens and more recently and then oxide semiconductors like IGZO really hitting mass production around 2012.
They kind of offered a balance between cost and performance

10
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:48,338
okay so stepping back a bit, how are these TFTS fundamentally different from say the transistors in a computer chip the bulk?

11
00:01:48,338 --> 00:02:02,360
Well, the big difference is the structure in a traditional MOSFET the silicon chip is the semiconductor substrate.
Everything's built into it. With TFTs, you start with an inert base so that glass or plastic and you build the semiconductor on top of it as a thin layer.

12
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,587
So it's not part of the base material itself

13
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:11,312
exactly. And that thin film approach isn't just about making things small it's what allows you to use all sorts of different substrates

14
00:02:11,312 --> 00:02:13,553
For us the users What is that on?

15
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:21,399
It opens up totally new possibilities for devices huge electronic surfaces, displays you can literally bend or roll

16
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,080
the foldable phones we're seeing now

17
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,804
precisely and even transparent electronics things you couldn't dream of doing with traditional silicon chips.
It really is a paradigm shift.

18
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:42,693
So your sources mention these different types Assi, LTPS, oxide TFTS like Igzo.
It sounds like engineers are always juggling different needs.
What drives choosing one over another

19
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:51,098
really comes down to balancing three things performance, cost and how easy it is to manufacture at scale.
It's that classic engineering triangle

20
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:54,460
Okay break that down for us let's start with aSi amorphous silicon

21
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:17,440
right? a-Si That's your workhorse.
It's cheap it's relatively easy to make and huge sheets screens think affordable TVS, monitors.
The catch is performance it's electron mobility basically how fast electrons move through it is pretty low maybe one cm²/Vs.
So it limits things like resolution and refresh rate.
Not great for high end gaming displays or super sharp phone screens.

22
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,677
Okay then there's LTPS,

23
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:37,420
LTPS low temperature polycrystalline silicon much faster mobility around 100 cm²/Vs is so way higher.
That's why you find it in premium stuff flagship smartphones, Highres VR headsets.
It allows for those really crisp, smooth, power efficient displays

24
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,100
It must be more expensive or harder to make.

25
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:47,500
Yeah exactly it's more complex, especially for really large panels.
Making it uniform over a huge TV screen is tricky and costly.

26
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,740
Brings us to the oxide ones like Igzo,

27
00:03:49,740 --> 00:04:17,869
IGZO indium gallium zinc oxide is the common one.
These kind of hit a sweet spot.
Their mobility is better than a-Si, typically over 10 cm²/Vs so good enough for high resolutions like a 4k, 8k.
But the really clever bit is their off current it's incredibly low meaning when a pixel is supposed to be off or just holding an image, it leaks very little electricity.
This saves a ton of power especially for still images.
And it lets displays use lower refresh rates without flickering

28
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:26,109
great for battery life. I plus, you can make them at lower temperatures than LTPS, making them more cost effective for those big high TV panels.

29
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:39,023
So just to recap, ASSI is the affordable standard.
LTPS is the high speed premium option and IGZO is kind of the efficient all rounder especially good for large sharp screens.

30
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:42,393
That sums it up pretty well.
Yeah you choose the Tech for the job.

31
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:50,326
We mostly think of TFTS for screens, TVS, phones, laptops but your sources point out they do a lot more.
Where else are they hiding?

32
00:04:50,326 --> 00:05:16,275
Oh, yeah their basic job is switching, right?
So that's useful in loads of places.
Think digital X ray detectors and hospitals.
TFTS read the signal head up displays in cars or planes use them lots of different sensors too biosensors, pressure sensors and they're really key for flexible electronics in general not displays.
There's even research into using them for neuromorphic computing trying to build circuits that work a bit like the human brain.

33
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:21,950
Wow okay so looking ahead what's the trajectory?
Where are TFTS going next?

34
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:41,889
Well, the push is definitely towards higher performance oxides and also these clever hybrid structures like Ltpo, Ltpo.
Yeah low temperature polycrystalline oxide.
It basically combines the best of both worlds using LTPS for parts of the circuit that need speed and oxide TFTS for the pixels themselves to save power

35
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:45,799
like on some high end phone screens that can vary their refresh rate

36
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:56,412
Exactly. It gives you that smooth motion when you need it but sips power when you don't. It's all about expanding what they can do, making them more efficient, integrating more functions directly onto the display panel.

37
00:05:56,412 --> 00:06:07,275
Wrapping this up from that first patent in 57 to these sophisticated hybrid displays today TFTS have really been well fundamental in shaping our digital lives, haven't they

38
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:14,008
Absolutely pivotal. They're these incredibly versatile little switches that just keep getting better, enabling all the visual and interactive Tech we rely on.

39
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:33,649
So a final thought for you listening think about how these thin films aren't just improving the devices we already have, but they're actually paving the way for totally new ways to interact with information and the world.
You know what kind of flexible, maybe even transparent display might you be using in a few years?
All thanks to this tiny switch technology.
